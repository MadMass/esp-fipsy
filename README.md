# Fipsy FPGA Programmer for ESP32

**esp-fipsy** library allows programming a [Fipsy FPGA breakout board](https://www.mocomakers.com/fipsy-fpga/) from an ESP32 microcontroller.
This library can only program the fuse table; it does not write the Feature Row or FEABITS.
[TcpFipsyLoader](examples/TcpFipsyLoader/) demonstrates how to use this library.
